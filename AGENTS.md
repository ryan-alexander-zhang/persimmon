# Guidelines 
## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Language Consistency

**Use one canonical term for one concept.**

- Use `CONTEXT.md` as the project glossary. If it does not exist, create it from `CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`.
- If a term conflicts with `CONTEXT.md`, stop and resolve it before moving on.
- If language is vague or overloaded, propose one precise term and test it against concrete scenarios.
- If the stated behavior conflicts with the code or docs, call out the mismatch explicitly.
- Update `CONTEXT.md` as soon as a term is resolved. Keep it glossary-only: no implementation details, specs, or design decisions.

## 6. Document Workflow

- For document work, including status transitions, follow `DOCUMENT.md`.
- As soon as a `spec`, `rule`, or `design` draft is written or substantively changed — and
  before a human is asked to review it — a subagent that did not write it audits it: first
  against that folder's `README.md`, then against the content itself. Name the missing
  rules, cases, and GWTs, the readings taken silently, and every value it cannot confirm.
  Each finding becomes an amendment or a named Open Question; what only a domain owner can
  settle is never left as an assumption.
- When writing the acceptance for a `spec` or a `rule`, derive the set per `ACCEPTANCE.md`.

## 7. Output Discipline

If one sentence answers it, answer in one sentence. Expand only when the user asks for
detail. Keep the formatting as short as the content: prose for short answers, no headings
or bullets over a single conclusion. This applies to documents too.

## 8. Development Workflow

- For implementation work, follow `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- After implementation, follow `TESTING.md`.
- Use `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the architecture index. If it does not exist, create it from `ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Before the first implementation `plan` turns `open`, fill the project-derived root guides
  from their templates and the `active` decisions/designs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, the Commands in
  `DEVELOPMENT.md`, the project-specific values in `TESTING.md` / `CODE_STYLE.md` /
  `CODE_QUALITY.md`. Never implement while a root guide the work depends on still holds
  template placeholders.
- When a quality gate fails (format / complexity / duplication / static analysis / coverage)
  or a review flags complexity or duplication, refactor per `CODE_QUALITY.md`: solve it — do
  not raise a threshold or suppress a finding to make the build pass.
- When you discover a bug or defect during any task, before fixing it, create a
  `docs/issue` doc: analyze the root cause from first principles and reproduce it
  with a failing test, following `docs/issue/README.md`. Only then apply the fix.
- Never write code or tests against a `draft` doc; it must be `active` (or `open` for a work item) first.
- Before a feature-sized `plan` becomes `resolved`, have a subagent verify from the docs that every linked `spec`/`rule` GWT has a passing test and that no `spec-<n>-FR-<i>` or `rule-<n>-BR-<i>` is unverified, then record a `docs/record/` acceptance checklist linking the GWT ids. Any gap blocks `resolved`.

## 9. Autopilot Mode

- When invoked as `/autopilot <prompt>` (or asked to run `AUTOPILOT.md`), follow `AUTOPILOT.md`:
  one intake round, then unattended through to a PR on an `autopilot/` branch. The human rounds
  in §1, §5, §6 and `DOCUMENT.md` are replaced exactly as that file states; a choice made in a
  human's place is a `decision` with `decided_by: agent`.
