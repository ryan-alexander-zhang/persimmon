# AI-Native Project Template

This repository is a docs-first template for starting an AI-native software
project.

It gives you a small, opinionated operating baseline for humans and coding
agents:

- root workflow docs for architecture, development, testing, security, style,
  commits, and PRs
- a project glossary template for keeping product, code, and docs vocabulary
  consistent
- a `docs/` taxonomy for durable product, engineering, and operational docs
- test-level guides that let each repo choose its own unit and E2E stack while
  pinning integration testing to Testcontainers and API testing to Bruno by
  default
- a local docs whiteboard that renders the `docs/` tree as a board and drives
  the review / promote / ask / co-write workflow

This is not a full application starter. It does not assume a frontend stack,
backend stack, or deployment platform. You bring the runtime code and keep the
workflow and documentation structure.

## What To Customize First

Start here after creating a repo from this template:

1. Update [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) with the intended system shape.
2. Update [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) with repo-specific working rules for agents.
3. Create `CONTEXT.md` from [CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md](CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md) and
   record the first project terms that need consistent usage.
4. Fill in the commands and project choices in:
   - [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)
   - [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
   - [UNIT_TESTING.md](UNIT_TESTING.md)
   - [INTEGRATION_TESTING.md](INTEGRATION_TESTING.md)
   - [API_TESTING.md](API_TESTING.md)
   - [E2E_TESTING.md](E2E_TESTING.md)
   - [CODE_QUALITY.md](CODE_QUALITY.md)
5. Use [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) to decide where durable docs belong.
6. Add your runtime code in the structure that fits the project.

## What To Customize vs Keep

**Language / framework — fill in per project:**

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — tech stack, module structure, boundaries
- [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) — the setup / build / test / lint / run commands
- [UNIT_TESTING.md](UNIT_TESTING.md) — choose the unit framework
- [E2E_TESTING.md](E2E_TESTING.md) — choose the E2E framework
- [INTEGRATION_TESTING.md](INTEGRATION_TESTING.md) — Testcontainers is pinned; fill in commands and environment
- [API_TESTING.md](API_TESTING.md) — Bruno is pinned; fill in base URL, auth, and command
- [CODE_QUALITY.md](CODE_QUALITY.md) — fill in the build-failing gates and any tuned
  threshold; the metrics and refactoring SOP stay as written

**Project / domain — fill in, but not language-driven:**

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — repo-specific agent rules
- `CONTEXT.md` (from [CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md](CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md)) — domain glossary
- [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md) — review checklist (starts empty)
- [THIRDPARTY.md](THIRDPARTY.md) — external reference-only sources
- [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md) — the derivation rules stay as written; fill in the
  omissions this domain actually produces

**Generic policy — keep as-is unless you are deliberately changing the way of working:**

- [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md), [COMMIT.md](COMMIT.md), [PR.md](PR.md),
  [DOCUMENT.md](DOCUMENT.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md),
  [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) (policy only — the framework choices live in the
  `*_TESTING.md` guides), and the [docs/](docs/README.md) taxonomy

## Docs Whiteboard

A local, single-user board over `docs/`: documents are nodes, front matter
relations are edges, and every action (review, promote, ask, co-write, annotate)
writes back to the Markdown files and commits.

```bash
cd tools/whiteboard && npm install && npm run build && npm start   # http://localhost:4173
```

Behavior is configured in [whiteboard.config.yaml](whiteboard.config.yaml); commands
and details in [tools/whiteboard/README.md](tools/whiteboard/README.md).

## Repo Map

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): behavior rules for coding agents in this repo
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md): top-level architecture summary
- [CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md](CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md): format spec for the `CONTEXT.md`
  project glossary
- [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md): implementation workflow and Definition of Done
- [DOCUMENT.md](DOCUMENT.md): document management rules
- [AUTOPILOT.md](AUTOPILOT.md): unattended idea-to-PR run
- [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md): how to derive the acceptance criteria a requirement owes
- [TESTING.md](TESTING.md): test-level policy and testing Definition of Done
- [CODE_QUALITY.md](CODE_QUALITY.md): quality gates and refactoring order
- [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md): project-specific review checklist (starts empty)
- [THIRDPARTY.md](THIRDPARTY.md): register of external reference-only sources
- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md): source of truth for the docs taxonomy
- [tools/whiteboard/README.md](tools/whiteboard/README.md): the docs whiteboard

## Suggested Adoption Flow

Use the template in this order:

1. Lock the working agreements at the repo root.
2. Capture product and engineering intent under `docs/`.
3. Add runtime code only after the architecture and workflow boundaries are
   clear enough for agents to follow.

That keeps the repo usable by both humans and agents before the implementation
surface grows.
