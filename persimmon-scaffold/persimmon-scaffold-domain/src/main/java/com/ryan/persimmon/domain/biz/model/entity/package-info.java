/**
 * Entities for the {@code biz} domain context.

 * <p>Entities have identity and mutable lifecycle. They typically live inside an aggregate boundary

 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Encapsulate state transitions behind behaviors that validate invariants.</li>
 *   <li>Keep entity identity stable and explicit.</li>
