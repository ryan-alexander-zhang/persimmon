/**
 * Business context root for the domain model.
 *
 * <p>All domain concepts that carry business meaning belong under this package. This repository uses
 * a single placeholder business context name {@code biz} for scaffolding; in a real project, you
 * typically replace it with the actual bounded context name (for example: {@code order}, {@code user},
 * {@code inventory}).</p>
 *
 * <h2>What belongs here</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Aggregates/entities/value objects and their invariants</li>
 *   <li>Domain services, policies, specifications</li>
 *   <li>Domain events and factories</li>
 *   <li>Domain-level ports (repositories/gateways) and domain exceptions</li>
