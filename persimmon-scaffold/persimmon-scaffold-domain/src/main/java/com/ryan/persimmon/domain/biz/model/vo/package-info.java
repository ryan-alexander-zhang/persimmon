/**
 * Value objects for the {@code biz} domain context.
 *
 * <p>Value objects are defined by their attributes rather than identity. They should be immutable
 * and self-validating (e.g. validating format/range at creation time).</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Prefer small, composable value objects over primitive obsession.</li>
 *   <li>Implement equality based on value semantics.</li>
