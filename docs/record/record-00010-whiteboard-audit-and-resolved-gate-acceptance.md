# 验收记录：审计评审动作与 plan 的 resolved 门

对 [plan-00010-whiteboard-audit-and-resolved-gate](../plan/plan-00010-whiteboard-audit-and-resolved-gate.md)
的验收。取舍见
[decision-00007](../decision/decision-00007-whiteboard-audit-and-resolved-gate.md)。
`rule-00001-BR-22` 是 agent 行为规则，不入本 plan 交付范围；其可断言面由
AC-50.2 的指令契约行承载。本 record 亦是 resolved 门的第一份真实证据——
plan-00010 的收口经白板的门放行完成。

## 质量门

- `npm test`：31 个文件、736 个测试全部通过（后端 407 + 前端 329）。
- `npm run typecheck`：`tsc --noEmit` 无错。
- `npm run test:coverage`：statements 99.33% / branches 95.39% /
  functions 98.89% / lines 99.76%，四项均高于 90% 门槛，未调整任何阈值。

## 实现期的既定取舍

- 审计指令不携带关系文档路径——FR-50 只枚举目标路径与文件夹 README，与
  澄清/答疑的 relatedPaths 是有意的差别。
- 「范围为空但含无法解析 id」拒绝流转：BR-25 的「无法解析视为缺口」独立于
  「范围为空不受约束」，取更严的读法（AC-52.5 的口径）。
- 可审计类型集在前后端各持一份代码内建副本（FR-50 的「代码内建」无配置
  通道），后续如要单一来源可走 `GET /api/config`。
- 门拒绝的 toast 文案随既有 UI 用英文（`N items unverified: …`），超过
  5 个 id 截断并保留计数。
