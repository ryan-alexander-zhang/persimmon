# Plans

This directory stores implementation plans.
Use `TEMPLATE.md` for front matter.

## Must Include

- Design — links to the [`design/`](../design/README.md) docs this plan builds.
  The design itself lives there, never inline here.
- Tasks
- Detailed Acceptance Path

Add more when useful.

## Relations

- `implements` — **required**: the `spec`, `rule`, and/or `design` this plan makes
  real, or the `report` whose findings a remediation plan works through. It is the
  only thing tying a plan to what it builds. Requirement-item ids
  (`spec-<n>-FR-<i>` / `rule-<n>-BR-<i>`) declare the plan's **delivery scope**
  (`rule-00001-BR-24`); a whole spec/rule doc id puts every item of that doc in
  scope. Prefer item ids when the plan delivers a slice of a larger spec.
- A feature-sized plan reaching `resolved` needs a [`record`](../record/README.md)
  whose `parent` points at this plan and whose `verifies` lists the requirement
  ids it checked. The board refuses `open → resolved` while any item in the
  delivery scope is not fully verified by such records (`rule-00001-BR-25`).

## Exclude

- pure product requirements
- detailed task lists

## Guideline

1. Keep tasks cohesive and low dependency. Tasks should be parallel when possible.
2. Acceptance should cover both: all split tasks are done, and the planned feature is tested and meets the target need.

## Note

If a plan is small, do not split it into `task/` dir.

A plan is a work item and uses the work-item status vocabulary. See
[docs/README.md](../README.md) for the shared definition.
