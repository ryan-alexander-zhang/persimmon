/**
 * Command DTOs for the {@code biz} context.
 *
 * <p>DTOs in this package represent data structures used to invoke command handlers. They should be
 * simple carriers of data, decoupled from domain types to keep external representations from
 * leaking into the model.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Validate DTOs at the boundary (adapter) and/or in the handler as appropriate.
 *   <li>Do not add domain logic to DTOs.
 * </ul>
