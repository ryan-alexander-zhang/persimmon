/**
 * Business context root for application use cases.
 *
 * <p>This demo uses {@code tenant} as the bounded context package name. The scaffold uses {@code
 * biz} as a placeholder and expects real projects to replace it with a specific context (e.g.
 * {@code order}, {@code user}). Within a context, organize
 * use cases into commands (write side) and queries (read side), and isolate orchestration concerns
 * from the domain model.
